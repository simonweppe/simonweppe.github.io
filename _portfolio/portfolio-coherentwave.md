title: "Coherent Waves ?"
excerpt: "A paper presented at the 2021 Coasts and Ports conference showing how complex nearshore bathymetries call for more complex phase-resolving wave model to correctly resolve wave processes (and how it somehow relates Nazare's giant waves)  <br/><img src='/images/mini650.png'>"

The initial project scope was to better understand wave processes near Townsville port entrance in Australia, which has a very long shipping channel, and what will happen if we widen and deepen it.

add plot with channel ?

Shipping channel are typically much deeper than surrounding areas, with sharp edges. When waves approach obliquely, intense wave refraction over the channel edge acts as if the channel "reflects" incoming waves. The incident waves and refracted waves combine and interfere in a crossed-wave pattern, we call them "coherent waves". 

These coherent wave effects can develop when incoming waves are scattered across multiple directions for example by sharp depth variations (e.g. here a channel), or current, which rise to wave interference patterns and can form focal zones (i.e. areas of significantly larger wave energy). It is obviously very important to reproduce these processes correcty when evalauting a wave condition to design a port structure for example. (SWASH also allow a better resolution of wave diffraction, which can be important at some sites).

These coherent wave processes are not accounted in more traditional phase-averaged wave models (SWAN, WW3) that propagate wave energy (radiative transfer equation) rather than indiviudal waves (phase resolving wave models).They assume waves propagating at an angle are mutually independent and that the wave field change slowly over several wavelengths. 

This means no reprodcution of the wave interference processes, and therefore a likely underestimation of predicetd waves (see paper for details, 25 to 40% underestimation).

Fun fact, these coherent wave effects are actually responsible for some of the largest waves on the planet. For example in Nazare (Portugal), a very deep submarine canyon, whose edges is aligned towards the surfbreak produce a crossing wave fields refracts incoming waves from the Nortwest to a southwest incidence. Southwest refracted waves mix with incoming nortwest waves to produce giant A-frame peaks right by the Nazare headland with its famous lighthouse. We do need a northwest swell for the magic to happen though. This intense convergence of wave energy will be much less evident when swells approach the canyon more straight from the west. The edge of the canyon will focus waves along its edges, but less wave crossing will develop. The photo below show some wave modelling of the break alongside some photos showing the typical crossed-wave patterns. 

Similar processes are at play in Blacks (California), and in fact many high-quality beach breaks holding large swells can often explain by similar features in the offshore bathymetry that nicely pre-condition the waves.
