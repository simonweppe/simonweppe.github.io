This [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335813398_Modelling_Surf_Break_Wave_Mechanics_with_SWASH_-_an_application_to_Mangamaunu_Point_Break_Kaikoura_New_Zealand) covers the wave modelling work undertaken for the Mangamanu Point surfbreak in New Zealand. This used the open-source, phase-resolving wave model [SWASH](swash.sourceforge.net/). New Zealand has been leading the regarding surfbreak protection by identifying and protecting a range of surfbreak of "national significance". Any proposed development around these surfbreaks is subject to a comprehensive impact assessment to evaluate possible adverse effects. 

A large earthquake in 2016 had damaged road and infrastructure in the region and a pedestrian and cycle path extending onto Mangamanu Point was considered as a part of the rebuilding effort. In that context, our scope was to first model the existing surfbreak during a few good surfing events to understand key features of the surfbreak wave mechanics (i.e. what "makes" the wave). Same simulations were reproduced with proposed structure in place to evaluate effects. We found the proposed structure, introduced additional wave reflection (backwash) which could adversly impact surfing conditions, especially during higher tides.

Based on this outcome and results of a wider surf break assessment [Shand et al., 2019](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tom-Shand/publication/336085131_Development_of_a_framework_for_assessing_effects_of_coastal_engineering_works_on_a_surf_break/links/5d8da6d3299bf10cff12c824/Development-of-a-framework-for-assessing-effects-of-coastal-engineering-works-on-a-surf-break.pdf), a decision was made by the developper to not progress with the construction.
