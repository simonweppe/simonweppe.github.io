[Aqualink](https://aqualink.org/) is a philanthropic engineering organization working on building ocean conservation technology. They provide wave and temperature sensor free of charge to monitor local reef ecosystems, across the planet - read more about their mission ]here](https://medium.com/aqualink/introducing-aqualink-dd1023393b8)


We collaborated with them to deploy a wave buoy off Raglan on the West Coast of New Zealand. NZ coasts are relatively data-poor with limited ocean observing systems, so this was a great opportunity to collect in-situ wave data, at a location exposed to southern ocean swells that will then propagate all across the Pacific, as well as temperature data.

The wave and temperature data is freely accessible [here.](https://spotters.sofarocean.com/overview?spotter-filter=SPOT-30182R)

Another fun deployment experience, yet for a shorter period [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-weppe-08217615/recent-activity/all/?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A%28urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7017944337162338304%2CFEED_DETAIL%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse%29)
