I am physical oceanographer with a wide range of "oceanic interests", both in the science and fun spaces. I grew up in Brittany (France) that has both a strong maritime heritage and is exposed to the full force of the Atlantic Ocean storms, so probably a source of inspiration there. I moved to New Zealand in 2008 to complete studies in physical oceanography, also lots of raw ocean and coastlines for the second home. After graduating, I started working with a, then small, science-based consultancy company called [MetOcean Solutions](https://www.metocean.co.nz/) based in Raglan, New Zealand, that has since grown to become the ocean modelling and forecasting unit of MetService NZ. Also did a stint with The Ocean Race (round-the-world sailing race) to improve and coordinate their Science Program


- High-resolution ocean wave modelling over complex nearshore bathymetries and how these affect wave propagation towards coastlines, ports, surfbreaks.

- Lagrangian "particle-tracking" modelling to **track anything, anywhere in the ocean**...oil spill, missing boat, viruses, contaminants, fish larvae, icebergs, sargassums...we can do it !

- Growing interest in Data Science and AI/machine learning to improve our ocean understanding and modelling ability.

- Open-source community data, codes and tools user (and advocate?), with a strong interest in "connecting the dots" to find solutions to real world problems.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
