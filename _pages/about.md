I am a physical oceanographer with a wide range of "oceanic interests", including science, conservation, and adventure. I grew up in Brittany (France) that has both a strong maritime heritage and is exposed to the full force of the Atlantic Ocean storms, so probably a source of inspiration there. I moved to New Zealand in 2008 to complete studies in physical oceanography, also lots of raw ocean and coastlines for the second home. After graduating, I started working with a, then small, science-based consultancy company called [MetOcean Solutions](https://www.metocean.co.nz/) based in Raglan, New Zealand, that has since grown to become the ocean modelling and forecasting unit of MetService NZ. I have recently been involved with The Ocean Race (round-the-world sailing race) to improve and coordinate their Science Program. 

Some of my main focuses below :   

- **High-resolution ocean wave modelling** - using phase-resolving wave models over complex nearshore bathymetries to explore how they affect wave propagation towards coastlines, ports, surfbreaks.

- **Oceanic dispersion modelling** - using Lagrangian "particle-tracking" models to **track anything, anywhere in the ocean**...oil spill, plastic, missing boat, viruses, contaminants, fish or shellfish larvae, icebergs, sargassum..

- **Open-source** community data, codes and tools user, with a keen interest in "connecting the dots" to find solutions to real world problems.  

- Growing interest in **Data Science and AI/machine learning** to improve our ocean understanding, modelling and prediction abilities. Check out [The Moana Project](https://www.moanaproject.org/) in which we are trying to better predict marine heatwaves using AI.
